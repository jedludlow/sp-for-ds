# Signal Processing for Data Scientists

A quick introduction to signal processing for data scientists.

## Getting Started

You'll need a Python environment with the packages in `environment.yml` installed.
This is most easily accomplished using the Anaconda Python distribution. After
installing Anaconda, run these commands from the root of the repository:

    conda env create
    source activate sp-for-ds
    jupyter notebook

Then open the notebook `sp_for_ds.ipynb`. Run all the cells in the notebook, and then
you can switch into slide display mode.
